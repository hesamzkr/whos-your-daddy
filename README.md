# A Minimal Approach to Architecture as Code: Documenting the Modern Way


> The question of "how much documentation should we write?" is popping up a lot recently, probably driven by teams looking
at their business continuity plans, and the increase in remote working.

If you've read [Simon Brown's take on a minimal approach to software architecture documentation](https://dev.to/simonbrown/a-minimal-approach-to-software-architecture-documentation-4k6k), you may have been intrigued by the approach but perhaps left wondering about its implementation. Although Simon Brown proposes a minimalist, three-part approach, he doesn't provide an example of it in practice. 

This repo fills that gap by presenting a concrete implementation template of Simon Brown's approach, which consists of:

1. [Software architecture models as code built with Structurizr Lite](#1-software-architecture-models-as-code)
2. [Documentation built with Arc42 template](#2-documentation)
3. [Decision log built with ADR Tools](#3-decision-log)

It's intended to store this documentation in a repository and treat it the same as code.

## What can I use this template for?
- Presale
- Project discovery
- [Solution Architecture Document (SAD)](https://almbok.com/method/sad#:~:text=A%20solution%20architecture%20document%20is,principles%20that%20guide%20its%20design.)
- Ongoing architecture documentation for your system

## How to run

- `docker compose up -d`
- Open web browser and go to [`http://localhost:8081/`](http://localhost:8081/)
- Happy documenting! ðŸ“š

## How to use Structurizr Lite

- Check [`http://localhost:8081/workspace/diagrams`](http://localhost:8081/workspace/diagrams) for diagrams
- Check [`http://localhost:8081/workspace/documentation/Internet%20Banking%20System`](http://localhost:8081/workspace/documentation/Internet%20Banking%20System)
  for documentation
- Check [`http://localhost:8081/workspace/decisions/Internet%20Banking%20System`](http://localhost:8081/workspace/decisions/Internet%20Banking%20System)
  for [ADRs](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
- Check [language reference](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl/blob/master/docs/language-reference.md) for dsl syntax
- Check [Getting started with Structurizr Lite](https://dev.to/simonbrown/getting-started-with-structurizr-lite-27d0)
  for more details
- Watch two talks at the bottom of the [C4 FAQ](https://c4model.com/#FAQ)
- [Arc42](https://arc42.org/overview) docs are in `internet-banking-system/docs`
- [ADRs](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) are in `internet-banking-system/adrs`

## What's inside?

### 1. Software architecture models as code

[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) builds upon "diagrams as code", allowing you to create *multiple software
architecture diagrams* from a *single model*.
There are a number of tools for creating Structurizr compatible workspaces, with
the [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl)
being the recommended option for most teams.
This Structurizr DSL example creates two diagrams, based upon a single set of elements and relationships.

```
workspace {

    model {
        user = person "User"
        softwareSystem = softwareSystem "Software System" {
            webapp = container "Web Application" {
                user -> this "Uses"
            }
            container "Database" {
                webapp -> this "Reads from and writes to"
            }
        }
    }

    views {
        systemContext softwareSystem {
            include *
            autolayout lr
        }

        container softwareSystem {
            include *
            autolayout lr
        }

        theme default
    }
```

### 2. Documentation


Because the code doesn't tell the whole story, Structurizr provides support for lightweight supplementary technical
documentation. The documentation is a collection of Markdown or AsciiDoc files, one per section, which are rendered in
the web browser. [Arc42](https://arc42.org/overview) template is used for the documentation.

### 3. Decision log

Because diagrams alone can't express the decisions that led to a solution, Structurizr allows you to supplement your
software architecture model with a decision log,
captured as a collection of lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
[as described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions),
and featured on
the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).
Structurizr allows you to publish your ADRs to allow team members get an "at a glance" view of the current set of ADRs,
along with facilities to make navigating them easier.

## Export & Integrations

### docToolChain

[docToolChain](https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain) is an implementation of the docs-as-code approach for
software architecture. The basis of docToolchain is the philosophy that software documentation should be treated in the
same way as code together with the arc42 template for software architecture.

### Notes for Confluence users

- If you consider to use confluence, the [asciidoc2confluence](https://github.com/rdmueller/asciidoc2confluence) script
  might be helpful.
