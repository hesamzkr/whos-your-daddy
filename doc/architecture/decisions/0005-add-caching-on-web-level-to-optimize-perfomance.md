# 5. Add caching on frontend level to optimize perfomance

Date: 2024-07-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To improve the performance of our web application, we need to implement caching. Our goal is to reduce load times and server requests without incurring additional costs for backend caching solutions like Redis.

## Decision

We will implement caching at the web application level. This approach will optimize performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user, reducing the need for repeated backend requests.
We decided to implement web-level caching to optimize performance and manage costs effectively.

## Consequences

### Benefits:

- Improved Performance: Reduced load times and quicker data retrieval for users.
- Cost Savings: Avoids additional expenses associated with backend caching solutions like Redis.
- Scalability: Enhances the application's ability to handle high traffic by reducing server load.

### Risks:

- Cache Invalidation: Ensuring cached data remains up-to-date and consistent can be challenging.
- Increased Complexity: Adding caching logic to the web application can complicate the development and maintenance process.

### Mitigation:

- Implement cache invalidation strategies to keep data current.
- Use web caching best practices to minimize complexity and ensure efficiency.
