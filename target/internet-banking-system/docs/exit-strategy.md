Data Migration:

- Data migration from AWS Neptune and PostgreSQL to on-premises or other cloud services.
- Use tools like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for relational database.
- Use data export/import methods for AWS Neptune.

Containerization:

- Ensure all applications (Web Application, API, Dashboard) are containerized using Docker.
- Maintain Docker images and configurations in a image repository.

Deployment Pipeline:

- Use CI/CD tools such as Github to automate the deployment process to cloud and change the pipelines to deploy to on-premises.
- Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts using tools like Terraform for reproducibility of cloud in case of going to new cloud or back to the cloud from on-premise.

Downtime Plan:

- Perform a full backup of database before migrations.
- Do not disrupt production traffic during the migration process.
- Change DNS to new on premise environment and after testing shutdown the cloud environment.
