== Cloud Exit Strategy

=== Data Migration

* Data migration from AWS Neptune and PostgreSQL to on-premises or other cloud services.
* Use tools like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for relational database.
* Use data export/import methods for AWS Neptune.

=== Containerization

* Ensure all applications (Web Application, API, Dashboard) are containerized using Docker.
* Maintain Docker images and configurations in an image repository.

=== Deployment Pipeline

* Use CI/CD tools such as GitHub to automate the deployment process to cloud and change the pipelines to deploy to on-premises.
* Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts using tools like Terraform for reproducibility of cloud in case of going to new cloud or back to the cloud from on-premises.

=== Downtime Plan

* Perform a full backup of the database before migrations.
* Do not disrupt production traffic during the migration process.
* Change DNS to the new on-premise environment and after testing, shut down the cloud environment.
* Merge the backedup database with the on-premises database.
