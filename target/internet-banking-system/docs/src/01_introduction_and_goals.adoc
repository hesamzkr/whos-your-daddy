== Introduction and Goals
build the world's largest genealogical graph in history
Organization wants to build the world's largest genealogical graph in history
Requirements: data is graph-like, open-ended, and must be viewable and searchable over a 
Users: millions of users, hundreds/thousands of third-party applications

variety of technology platforms (web, mobile, etc);
API allowing third-party access to all of the data;
historical records (census, marriage, death, parish records, etc) are being added
by teams of people in the field--each record must be viewed/transcribed and scanned twice and verified


=== Requirements Overview
User wants to upload his genealogical story.
User wants to view his genealogical story.
User wants to search his genealogical story.
User wants to grant acces to genealogical data.



=== Quality Goals
- Scalability
- Security
- Interoperability

=== Quality Scenarios

==== Scalability

- **Source**: User
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to find for ancestors
- **Environment**: Under peak load conditions
- **Response**: The user is able to find the data
- **Response Measure**: The system is able to handle requests from millions of users without hurting performance

- **Source**: Third-party application
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access the API
- **Environment**: Under peak load conditions
- **Response**: The application is able to access the API
- **Response Measure**: The system is able to handle requests from hundreds/thousands of third-party applications without hurting performance

==== Security

- **Source**: User
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access sensitive genealogical data
- **Environment**: Under normal conditions
- **Response**: The system verifies the user's permissions before granting access
- **Response Measure**: Access is only granted to users with the correct permissions

==== Interoperability

- **Source**: Third-party application
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access the API documentation
- **Environment**: Under normal conditions
- **Response**: The application is able to access the API documentation and understand how to use the API
- **Response Measure**: The API documentation works and is easy to understand
