== Introduction and Goals

Goals

- Build the world's largest genealogical graph in history
- Provide an API for third-party applications to access the data
- Provide a platform for users to see & upload their genealogical stories
- Provide a dashboard platform for external API users to communicate with the platform

=== Requirements Overview

- User wants to upload his genealogical story.
- User wants to view his genealogical story.
- User wants to search his genealogical story.
- User wants to grant acces to genealogical data.


=== Quality Goals

- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle requests from hundreds of active users without hurting performance

- **Security**: The system must verify the user's permissions before granting access

- **Interoperability**: The system must be able to serve third-party applications and provide them with the necessary documentation to access the API

=== Quality Scenarios

==== Scalability

- **Source**: User
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to find for ancestors
- **Environment**: Under peak load conditions
- **Response**: The user is able to find the data
- **Response Measure**: The system is able to handle requests from hundreds of active users without hurting performance

---

- **Source**: Third-party application
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access the API
- **Environment**: Under peak load conditions
- **Response**: The application is able to access the API
- **Response Measure**: The system is able to handle requests from hundreds/thousands of third-party applications without hurting performance

==== Security

- **Source**: User
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access sensitive genealogical data
- **Environment**: Under normal conditions
- **Response**: The system verifies the user's permissions before granting access
- **Response Measure**: Access is only granted to users with the correct permissions

==== Interoperability

- **Source**: Third-party application
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access the API documentation
- **Environment**: Under normal conditions
- **Response**: The application is able to access the API documentation and understand how to use the API
- **Response Measure**: The API documentation works and is easy to understand
